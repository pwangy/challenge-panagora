# Panagora Code Test

## What is this?
A code test from Panagora as part of their recruitment process. If you're curious to read the assignment directions look at the ReadMe under `design`. 

## Completed Tasks and Approach
- Build a single page appliction with JavaScript using the starter files provided.
- Added necessary libraries for React and React Router.
- Fussed with webpack.config and learned about adding to this file. This bit was important because I needed to be able to see what the app looked like as I was working on it. Figuring out Webpack took a good chunk of time since it wasn't something I've worked with in development as much or have had to set up so it was a good opportunity to learn about it. More or less I spent this time searching online for the error messages I received and worked things out from there. 
Once I was able to see a local instance of my app, I set about building out components and focused on functionality (navigation works, fetching data and rendering it on a page works, etc). Styling was the step I started in on after getting all the elements rendered successfully.
- Defined the routes for Router for basic navigation and created the Navigation components.
- Set up a Products page to list the array of products and bring in images and descriptive info. 
- Set up how an individual product page should render in the Product component. 
- Learned about SCSS structure implemented the defined styles found in the style guide.
