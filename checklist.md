# Panagora Code Test

## What's here?
- `static/` static assets that you will need
- `<PRODUCT_ID>.json`
- `products.json`

## Instructions
In `data/` you will find a couple of json files that will act as your "backend". `products.json` holds a list of simplified product representations and `<PRODUCT_ID>.json` is an actual product representation.


:: INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT PAGE
When clicking on one of the products we want to see a product page with full product info and a form to add the product to a cart. Layout this page however you want but use the design elements from the styleguide.



**Important:** 
Please tell us how much time you spent on this and describe your work to us! Just a couple of sentences of each step you took or if something was unclear and how you solved it.
